		<h2>Home</h2>
		<p>Welcome to Mellow Sable, where we design and build custom reading nooks tailored to your space and style. Our mission is to create the perfect sanctuary for winding down, diving into a good book, and mellowing out after a long day.</p>
		
		<p>Every reading nook we craft is a personalized retreat designed with comfort, aesthetics, and functionality in mind. From cozy window seats with built-in bookshelves to luxurious corner alcoves with soft lighting and plush seating, we transform underutilized spaces into your favorite spot in the home.</p>
		
		<p>Whether you dream of a minimalist Scandinavian hideaway or a richly textured bohemian escape, Mellow Sable brings your vision to life. We handle everything from initial design consultation to final installation, ensuring every detail reflects your personality and reading habits.</p>
