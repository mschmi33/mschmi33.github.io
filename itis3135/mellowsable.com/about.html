        <h2>Mellow Sable</h2>
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Mellow Sable was founded on the belief that everyone deserves a dedicated space to unwind, escape, and immerse themselves in the worlds found between the pages of a book. In our fast-paced world, having a personal retreat isn't just a luxury—it's essential for mental well-being.</p>
		
		<h3>Our Story</h3>
		<p>What started as a personal project to transform an unused corner of a home into a reading sanctuary has blossomed into a full-service custom nook design company. We've helped dozens of book lovers, busy professionals, and families create spaces that invite relaxation and inspire a love of reading.</p>
		
		<h3>What We Do</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Custom Design:</strong> We work with you to understand your space, style preferences, and reading habits</li>
			<li><strong>Quality Craftsmanship:</strong> Every nook is built with premium materials and attention to detail</li>
			<li><strong>Complete Installation:</strong> From demolition to final touches, we handle the entire process</li>
			<li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Built-in lighting, storage, cushions, and décor tailored to you</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
		<p>We believe that the best reading nooks balance form and function. They're beautiful enough to enhance your home's aesthetics, comfortable enough to spend hours in, and practical enough to store your growing book collection. Every project begins with listening to your needs and ends with a space that feels uniquely yours.</p>
		
		<p>Whether you have a small apartment with a sunny window or a spacious home with an empty alcove, Mellow Sable can transform it into your personal literary escape.</p>
